# opensubtitles-parser
This automates the process of downloading, extracting, and tokeninzing all the text from the opensubtitles dataset into one large corpus text file. Each phrase is on it's own line, and each phrase is delimited by a space separating each token in the phrase.

##Notes

Some words are appearing in the corpus file without a space between tokens (ex/ and the -> andthe) I don't know if this is from the original dataset, or a problem with my script. I need to look more into it.
